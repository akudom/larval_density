# Introduction

Andreas ran an experiment where containers had `r larval_density_df %>% pull(larval_density) %>% unique()` *Anopheles gambiae* eggs placed within them. 
`r larval_density_df %>% pull(replicate_no) %>% unique() %>% (length)` simultaneous replicates of different larval densities were performed, over `r larval_density_df %>% pull(date_of_experiment) %>% unique() %>% length()` iterations. 
Iterations either had `r sp[1]` or `r sp[2]` varieties used.  
Three sets of variables were measured:  

1. Number of larvae per surviving until pupation per replicate
2. For larvae that survived until pupation, number of days between hatching and:
    + pupation
    + eclosion
3. Wing length for a subset of larvae that survived until eclosion.


# Survival rates
